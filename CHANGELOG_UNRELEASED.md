## [0.4.0] - 2022-03-15

### Added

* Added new option `showPoiNames` to `LibrarySettings` that allows the name of the POIs to be displayed on the map above each POI icon. If it is set to true, the POI name is displayed above the POI icon, if it is set to false, only the POI icon appears. By default it is set to false. :warning: Only in iOS for now, coming soon to Android.

### Changed

* Updated iOS WYF native dependency to version to 0.3.0
